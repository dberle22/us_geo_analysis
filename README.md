An analysis on US Geographic and Demographic data

Summary
The US is a huge, continent-wide, diverse nation. To understand it better it’s important to understand the demographic and geographic makeup of the country. Here, I will be exploring a few key indicators to better understand the country

Main Questions:
What areas have grown the fastest in the past 10 years? This is our indicator for “performance”.
What areas are most similar to our baseline of our top growing areas? In this case, we are using Nashville and Austin as baseline cities.
Within these areas what are the top performing zip codes or census tracts? We are trying to understand what sub-areas have performed best within the area and identify other sub-areas that may perform well in the future.
